One sided t-test in R:

        Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  result by type
t = -1.1194, df = 196.58, p-value = 0.8678
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.173341       Inf
sample estimates:
mean in group class  mean in group comp 
               0.70                0.77 

We can be 95% that the true mean difference is greater than 0 (-0.17, INF)
