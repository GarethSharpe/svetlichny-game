Two sided t-test in R:

        Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  result by type
t = -1.1194, df = 196.58, p-value = 0.2643
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.19331731  0.05331731
sample estimates:
mean in group class  mean in group comp 
               0.70                0.77 


There is little to no evidence to suggest that the difference in means
is grater than 0. As such, we cannot reject the null hypothesis with a 
p-value of 0.2643 and a 95% confidence interval of (-0.19, 0.05).
